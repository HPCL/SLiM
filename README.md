Development & Feedback
-----------------------------------
SLiM is under active development, and our goal is to make it as broadly useful as possible.  If you have feedback or feature requests, or if you are interested in contributing to SLiM, please contact Philipp Messer at [messer@cornell.edu](mailto:messer@cornell.edu). Please note that Philipp is also looking for graduate students and postdocs.


Installation from source
----------------------------------

We use CMake, with an out-of-source build, as described here:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/FAQ#out-of-source-build-trees

CMake is available with `port install cmake` or `brew install cmake` (on OS X, with MacPorts or Homebrew respectively), or with `aptitude install cmake` (on debian).

To compile the development version from this repository, do:

	git clone https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM.git
	mkdir SLiM_build
	cd SLiM_build
	cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../SLiM
	make

The resulting binary will be called `slim`, within the `SLiM_build` directory.  You can name the build directory anything you wish; there is nothing magical about the name `SLiM_build`.

To update the build, in the `SLiM_build` directory run:

	cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../SLiM
	make

To build the code with debug flags turned on (i.e., optimization turned off, debugging symbols turned on, and extra runtime checking enabled), run instead:

	cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../SLiM
	make

This could be done in a separate directory to retain both versions of the build.

See the SLiM manual for more information about building and installing, including instructions on building SLiMgui under Xcode.  The manual and other SLiM stuff can be found at [http://messerlab.org/slim/](http://messerlab.org/slim/).
