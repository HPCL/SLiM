\f0\fs20 \cf0 The color used to display substitutions in SLiMgui when both mutations and substitutions are being displayed in the chromosome view.  Outside of SLiMgui, this property still exists, but is not used by SLiM.  Colors may be specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB values of the form

\f0\fs20 , SLiMgui will defer to the color scheme of each 
\f2\fs18 MutationType

\f2\fs18 "3333FF"
\f0\fs20 , causes all substitutions to be shown as dark blue when displayed in conjunction with mutations, to prevent the view from becoming too noisy.

\pard\pardeftab397\li547\ri720\sb60\sa60\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Set the recombination rate per nucleotide per generation along the chromosome.  There are two ways to call this method.  If the optional 
\f2\fs18 ends
\f0\fs20  parameter is 
\f2\fs18 NULL
\f0\fs20  (the default), then 
\f2\fs18 rates
\f0\fs20  must be a singleton value that specifies a single recombination rate to be used along the entire chromosome.  If, on the other hand, 
\f2\fs18 ends
\f0\fs20  is supplied, then 
\f2\fs18 rates
\f0\fs20  and 
\f2\fs18 ends
\f0\fs20  must be the same length, and the values in 
\f2\fs18 ends
\f0\fs20  must be specified in ascending order.  In that case, 
\f2\fs18 rates
\f0\fs20  and 
\f2\fs18 ends
\f0\fs20  taken together specify the recombination rates to be used along successive contiguous stretches of the chromosome, from beginning to end; the last position specified in 
\f2\fs18 ends
\f0\fs20  should extend to the end of the chromosome (i.e. to exactly the same length as the previously specified recombination intervals extended to).  See the 
\f2\fs18 initializeRecombinationRate()
\f0\fs20  function for further discussion of precisely how these rates and positions are interpreted.\
If the optional 
\f2\fs18 sex
\f0\fs20  parameter is 
\f2\fs18 "*"
\f0\fs20  (the default), then the supplied recombination rate map will be used for both sexes (which is the only option for hermaphroditic simulations).  In sexual simulations 
\f2\fs18 sex
\f0\fs20  may be 
\f2\fs18 "M"
\f0\fs20  or 
\f2\fs18 "F"
\f0\fs20  instead, in which case the supplied recombination map is used only for that sex.  Note that whether sex-specific recombination maps will be used is set by the way that the simulation is initially configured with 
\f2\fs18 initializeRecombinationRate()
\f0\fs20 , and cannot be changed with this method; so if the simulation was set up to use sex-specific maps then sex must be 
\f2\fs18 "M"
\f0\fs20  or 
\f2\fs18 "F"
\f0\fs20  here, whereas if it was set up not to, then sex must be 
\f2\fs18 "*"
\f0\fs20  or unsupplied here.  If a simulation needs sex-specific recombination maps only some of the time, the male and female maps can simply be set to be identical the rest of the time.\
The recombination intervals are normally a constant in simulations, so be sure you know what you are doing.\

Note that the

\f0\fs20  objects used by SLiM are new with every generation, so the

\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  value for an offspring genome inside a 
\f2\fs18 modifyChild()
\f0\fs20  callback, that 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  value will be preserved as the offspring individual becomes a parent (across the generation boundary, in other words).  If you take advantage of this, however, you should be careful to set up initial values for the tag values of 
\i all
\i0  offspring, otherwise undefined initial values might happen to match the values that you are trying to use to tag particular individuals.  A rule of thumb in programming: undefined values should always be assumed to take on the most inconvenient value possible.

\f0 In SLiM, it is often possible for a single individual to have multiple mutations at a given base position.  Because the VCF format is an explicit-nucleotide format, this property of SLiM does not fit well into VCF.  Since there are only four possible nucleotides at a given base position in VCF, at most one \'93reference\'94 state and three \'93alternate\'94 states could be represented at that base position.  SLiM, on the other hand, can represent any number of alternative possibilities at a given base; in general, if 
\i N
\i0  different mutations are segregating at a given position, there are 2
\i \super N
\i0 \nosupersub  different allelic states at that position in SLiM.  For this reason, SLiM does not attempt to represent multiple mutations at a single site as being alternative alleles in a single output line, as is typical in VCF format.  Instead, SLiM produces a separate line of VCF output for each segregating mutation at a given position.  SLiM always declares base positions as having a \'93reference base\'94 of 
\f2\fs18 A
\f0\fs20  (representing the state in individuals that do not carry a given mutation) and an \'93alternate base\'94 of 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  (representing the state in individuals that do carry the given mutation).  Multiallelic positions will thus produce VCF output showing multiple 
\f2\fs18 A
\f0\fs20 -to-
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  changes at the same position, possessed by different but possibly overlapping sets of individuals.  Many programs that process VCF output may not behave correctly with this style of output.  SLiM therefore provides a choice, using the 
\f2\fs18 outputMultiallelics
\f0\fs20  flag; if that flag is 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  (the default), SLiM will produce multiple lines of output for multiallelic base positions, but will mark those lines with a 
\f2\fs18 MULTIALLELIC
\f0\fs20  flag in the 
\f2\fs18 INFO
\f0\fs20  field of the VCF output so that those lines can be filtered or processed in a special manner.  If 
\f2\fs18 outputMultiallelics
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 F
\f0\fs20 , on the other hand, SLiM will completely suppress output of all mutations at multiallelic sites \'96 often the simplest option, if doing so does not lead to bias in the subsequent analysis.  This flag has no effect upon the output of sites with only a single mutation present.  Assessment of whether a site is multiallelic is done only within the sample; segregating mutations that are not part of the sample are ignored.\

\f2\fs18 outputMS()

\f2\fs18 output()

\f2\fs18 mutations
\f0\fs20  property), until the next generation.\
Changing this will normally affect the fitness values calculated at the end of the current generation; if you want current fitness values to be affected, you can call

\f2\fs18 substitute
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 Substitution
\f0\fs20  objects will be created for all of the removed mutations so that they are recorded in the simulation as having fixed, just as if they had reached fixation and been removed by SLiM\'92s own internal machinery.  This will occur regardless of whether the mutations have in fact fixed, regardless of the 
\f2\fs18 convertToSubstitution
\f0\fs20  property of the relevant mutation types, and regardless of whether all copies of the mutations have even been removed from the simulation (making it possible to create 
\f2\fs18 Substitution
\f0\fs20  objects for mutations that are still segregating).  It is up to the caller to perform whatever checks are necessary to preserve the integrity of the simulation\'92s records.  Typically 
\f2\fs18 substitute

\f0\fs20  value (as opposed to 
\f2\fs18 tagF
\f0\fs20 , which is of type 
\f2\fs18 float
\f0\fs20 ).  The value of 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  is initially undefined; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself.  The value of 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use.  See also the 
\f2\fs18 getValue()
\f0\fs20  and 
\f2\fs18 setValue()
\f0\fs20  methods, for another way of attaching state to individuals.\
Note that the 
\f2\fs18 Individual
\f0\fs20  objects used by SLiM are (conceptually) new with every generation, so the 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  value of each new offspring generated in each generation will be initially undefined.  If you set a 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  value for an offspring individual inside a 
\f2\fs18 modifyChild()
\f0\fs20  callback, that 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  value will be preserved as the offspring individual becomes a parent (across the generation boundary, in other words).  If you take advantage of this, however, you should be careful to set up initial values for the tag values of 
\i all
\i0  offspring, otherwise undefined initial values might happen to match the values that you are trying to use to tag particular individuals.  A rule of thumb in programming: undefined values should always be assumed to take on the most inconvenient value possible.

\f0\fs20 -type 
\f2\fs18 tag

\f2\fs18 -countOfMutationsOfType()
\f0\fs20 .  This method is provided for speed; it is much faster than the corresponding Eidos code.  Indeed, it is faster than just 
\f2\fs18 individual.genomes.mutationsOfType(mutType)
\f0\fs20 , and gives uniquing and sorting on top of that, so it is advantageous unless duplicate entries for homozygous mutations are actually needed.

\f0\fs20  is

\f0\fs20  (the default), then

\f0   The

\f0\fs20  vector is interpreted as providing coordinates precisely as specified by the spatiality of the interaction type; if the interaction type\'92s spatiality is

\f0\fs20  is assumed to be a

\f0\fs20  property for

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Returns up to 
\f2\fs18 count
\f0\fs20  individuals drawn from the subpopulation of 
\f2\fs18 individual
\f3\fs20 .
\f0   The probability of drawing particular individuals is proportional to their strength of interaction with 
\f2\fs18 individual
\f0\fs20 .  This method may be used with either spatial or non-spatial interactions, but will be more efficient with spatial interactions that set a short maximum interaction distance.  Draws are done with replacement, so the same individual may be drawn more than once; sometimes using 
\f2\fs18 unique()
\f0\fs20  on the result of this call is therefore desirable.  If more than one draw will be needed, it is much more efficient to use a single call to 
\f2\fs18 drawByStrength()
\f0\fs20 , rather than drawing individuals one at a time.  Note that if no individuals have a non-zero interaction with 
\f2\fs18 individual
\f0\fs20 , the vector returned will be zero-length; it is important to consider this possibility.\
If the needed interaction strengths have already been calculated, those cached values are simply used.  Otherwise, calling this method triggers evaluation of the needed interactions, including calls to any applicable 
\f2\fs18 interaction()
\f0\fs20  callbacks.\

\f0\fs20  (or for all subpopulations, if

\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 NULL
\f0\fs20 ).  By default, the effects of this may be limited, however, since the underlying implementation may choose to postpone some computations lazily.  At a minimum, is it guaranteed that this method will discard all previously cached data for the subpopulation(s), and will cache the current positions of all individuals (so that individuals may then move without disturbing the state of the interaction at the moment of evaluation).  Notably, 
\f2\fs18 interaction()
\f0\fs20  callbacks may not be called in response to this method; instead, their evaluation may be deferred until required to satisfy queries (at which point the generation counter may have advanced by one, so be careful with the generation ranges used in defining such callbacks).\
If 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  is passed for 
\f2\fs18 immediate
\f0\fs20 , the interaction will immediately and synchronously evaluate all interactions between all individuals in the subpopulation(s), calling any applicable 
\f2\fs18 interaction()
\f0\fs20  callbacks as necessary.  However, depending upon what queries are later executed, this may represent considerable wasted computation, since it is an O(N\super 2\nosupersub ) operation.  Immediate evaluation usually generates only a slight performance improvement even if the interactions between all pairs of individuals are eventually accessed; the main reason to choose immediate evaluation, then, is that deferred calculation of interactions would lead to incorrect results due to changes in model state.\
If an interaction is never evaluated for a given subpopulation, it is guaranteed that there will be essentially no memory or computational overhead associated with the interaction for that subpopulation.  Furthermore, attempting to query an interaction for an individual in a subpopulation that has not been evaluated is guaranteed to raise an error.

For one individual, this is essentially the same as calling

\f0\fs20  so as to obtain the complete vector of all neighbors, calling

\f2\fs18 totalOfNeighborStrengths()
\f0\fs20  can total up interactions for more than one focal individual in a single call.\
Similarly, for one individual this is essentially the same as calling

\f0\fs20  (which may be specified as either an 
\f2\fs18 integer
\f0\fs20  identifier or a 
\f2\fs18 MutationType
\f0\fs20  object).  This implicitly changes the dominance coefficient of the mutation to that of the new mutation type, since the dominance coefficient is a property of the mutation type.

\f0\fs20  method if so desired.\
The mutation type of a mutation is normally a constant in simulations, so be sure you know what you are doing.  Changing this will normally affect the fitness values calculated at the end of the current generation; if you want current fitness values to be affected, you can call

\f0\fs20 \cf0 This property governs whether mutations of this mutation type will be converted to

\f0\fs20  objects when they reach fixation.  This property is 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  by default, since conversion to

\f0\fs20  objects provides large speed benefits; it should be set to 
\f2\fs18 F
\f0\fs20  only if necessary, and only on the mutation types for which it is necessary.  This might be needed, for example, if you are using a 
\f2\fs18 fitness()
\f0\fs20  callback to implement an epistatic relationship between mutations; a mutation epistatically influencing the fitness of other mutations through a 
\f2\fs18 fitness()
\f0\fs20  callback would need to continue having that influence even after reaching fixation, but if the simulation were to replace the fixed mutation with a 
\f2\fs18 Substitution
\f0\fs20  object the mutation would no longer be considered in fitness calculations (unless the callback explicitly consulted the list of 
\f2\fs18 Substitution
\f0\fs20  objects kept by the simulation)

\f0\fs20  callbacks might also necessitate the disabling of substitution for a given mutation type; this is an important consideration to keep in mind.\
SLiM consults this flag at the end of each generation when deciding whether to substitute each fixed mutation.  If you change this flag to 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20 , all eligible fixed mutations will be converted at the end of the current generation, even if they were previously left unconverted because of the previous value of the flag.  Setting this flag to 
\f2\fs18 F
\f0\fs20  will prevent future substitutions, but will not cause any existing 
\f2\fs18 Substitution

\f0\fs22 .  A Weibull distribution is often used to model mutations following extreme-value theory.\

\f2\fs18 "s"
\f0\fs22  \'96 A 
\b s
\b0 cript-based fitness effect.  This DFE type is specified by a script parameter of type 
\f2\fs18 string
\f0\fs22 , specifying an Eidos script to be executed to produce each new selection coefficient.  For example, the script 
\f2\fs18 "return rbinom(1);"
\f0\fs22  could be used to generate selection coefficients drawn from a binomial distribution, using the Eidos function 
\f2\fs18 rbinom()
\f0\fs22 , even though that mutational distribution is not supported by SLiM directly.  The script must return a singleton float or integer.  Only the intrinsic Eidos constants and functions are available within a DFE script, for simplicity of implementation; SLiM-defined constants, variables, functions, and classes are not available.\
Note that these distributions can in principle produce selection coefficients smaller than 
\f2\fs18 -1.0. 
\f0\fs22 In that case
\f3 ,
\f0  the mutations will be evaluated as \'93lethal\'94 by SLiM, and the relative fitness of the individual will be set to

\f0\fs20 \cf0 This property governs whether mutations of this mutation type can \'93stack\'94 \'96 can occupy the same position in a single individual.  This property is 
\f2\fs18 "s"
\f0\fs20  by default, indicating that mutations of this type should be allowed to stack without restriction.  If the policy is set to 
\f2\fs18 "f"
\f0\fs20 , the 
\i first
\i0  mutation of this type at a given site is retained; further mutations of this type at the same site are discarded with no effect.  This can be useful for modeling one-way changes to single nucleotides, for example; once a 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  changes to an 
\f2\fs18 A
\f0\fs20 , further changes of the 
\f2\fs18 A
\f0\fs20  to an 
\f2\fs18 A
\f0\fs20  are not changes at all.  If the policy is set to 
\f2\fs18 "l"
\f0\fs20 , the last mutation of this type at a given site is retained; earlier mutation of this type at the same site are discarded.  This can be useful for modeling an \'93infinite-alleles\'94 scenario in which every new mutation at a site generates a completely new allele, rather than retaining the previous mutations at the site.\
The mutation stacking policy applies only within the given mutation type; mutations of different mutation types are always allowed to stack in SLiM.  The policy applies to all mutations added to the model after the policy is set, whether those mutations are introduced by calls such as 
\f2\fs18 addMutation()
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 addNewMutation()
\f0\fs20 , or 
\f2\fs18 addNewDrawnMutation()
\f0\fs20 , or are added by SLiM\'92s own mutation-generation machinery.  However, no attempt is made to enforce the policy for mutations already existing at the time the policy is set; typically, therefore, the policy is set in an 
\f2\fs18 initialize()
\f0\fs20  callback so that it applies throughout the simulation.  The policy is also not enforced upon the mutations loaded from a file with 
\f2\fs18 readFromPopulationFile()
\f0\fs20 ; such mutations were governed by whatever stacking policy was in effect when the population file was generated.

\f2\fs18 filePath
\f0\fs20  is

\f0\fs20  (the default), output will be sent to Eidos\'92s output stream.  Otherwise, output will be sent to the filesystem path specified by

\f0   When writing to a file, a 
\f2\fs18 logical
\f0\fs20  flag, 
\f2\fs18 binary
\f0\fs20 , may be supplied as well.  If 
\f2\fs18 binary
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20 , the population state will be written as a binary file instead of a text file (binary data cannot be written to the standard output stream).  The binary file is usually smaller, and in any case will be read much faster than the corresponding text file would be read.  Binary files are not guaranteed to be portable between platforms; in other words, a binary file written on one machine may not be readable on a different machine (but in practice it usually will be, unless the platforms being used are fairly unusual).  If 
\f2\fs18 binary
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 F
\f0\fs20  (the default), a text file will be written.\
Beginning with SLiM 2.3, the 
\f2\fs18 spatialPositions
\f0\fs20  parameter may be used to control the output of the spatial positions of individuals in simulations for which continuous space has been enabled using the 
\f2\fs18 dimensionality
\f0\fs20  option of 
\f2\fs18 initializeSLiMOptions()
\f3\fs20 .
\f0   If 
\f2\fs18 spatialPositions
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 F
\f0\fs20 , the output will not contain spatial positions, and will be identical to the output generated by SLiM 2.1 and later.  If 
\f2\fs18 spatialPositions
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20 , spatial position information will be output if it is available.  If the simulation does not have continuous space enabled, the 
\f2\fs18 spatialPositions
\f0\fs20  parameter will be ignored.  Positional information may be output for all output destinations \'96 the Eidos output stream, a text file, or a binary file.
\f3 \

\f0 Output is generally done in a 
\f2\fs18 late()
\f0\fs20  event, so that the output reflects the state of the simulation at the end of a generation.

\f2\fs18 filePath

\f0\fs20  will be removed as a side effect of this method, since all such variables would refer to objects that no longer exist in the SLiM simulation; if you want to preserve any of that state, you should output it or save it to a file prior to this call.  New symbols will be defined to refer to the new 
\f2\fs18 Subpopulation
\f0\fs20  objects loaded from the file.  Fitness values will be calculated immediately for any new subpopulations created by this call, which will trigger the calling of any activated and applicable 
\f2\fs18 fitness()
\f0\fs20  callbacks.  Note that it is likely to be better to call 
\f2\fs18 readFromPopulationFile()
\f0\fs20  in a 
\f2\fs18 late()
\f0\fs20  event, so that fitness values are being recalculated at the usual time in the generation life cycle.\
As of SLiM 2.1, this method changes the generation counter to the generation read from the file.  If you do not want the generation counter to be changed, you can change it back after reading, by setting 
\f2\fs18 sim.generation
\f0\fs20  to whatever value you wish.  Note that restoring a saved past state and running forward again will not yield the same simulation results, because the random number generator\'92s state will not be the same; to ensure reproducibility from a given time point, 
\f2\fs18 setSeed()
\f0\fs20  can be used to establish a new seed value.  Any changes made to the simulation\'92s structure (mutation types, genomic element types, etc.) will not be wiped and re-established by 
\f2\fs18 readFromPopulationFile()
\f0\fs20 ; this method loads only the population\'92s state, not the simulation configuration, so care should be taken to ensure that the simulation structure meshes coherently with the loaded data.\
As of SLiM 2.3, this method will read and restore the spatial positions of individuals if that information is present in the output file and the simulation has enabled continuous space (see 
\f2\fs18 outputFull()
\f0\fs20  for details).  If spatial positions are present in the output file but the simulation has not enabled continuous space (or the number of spatial dimensions does not match), an error will result.  If the simulation has enabled continuous space but spatial positions are not present in the output file, the spatial positions of the individuals read will be undefined, but an error is not raised.\

New symbols will be defined to refer to the new

If the file being read was written by a version of SLiM prior to 2.3, then for backward compatibility fitness values will be calculated immediately for any new subpopulations created by this call, which will trigger the calling of any activated and applicable 
\f2\fs18 fitness()
\f0\fs20  callbacks.  When reading files written by SLiM 2.3 or later, fitness values are not calculated as a side effect of this call (because the simulation will often need to evaluate interactions or modify other state prior to doing so).  Furthermore, in SLiM 2.3 and later calling 
\f2\fs18 readFromPopulationFile()
\f0\fs20  from any context other than a 
\f2\fs18 late()
\f0\fs20  event causes a warning; calling from a 
\f2\fs18 late()
\f0\fs20  event is almost always correct, so that fitness values can be automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual time in the generation life cycle without the need to force their recalculation (see chapter 17, and comments on 
\f2\fs18 recalculateFitness()
\f0\fs20  below).\
As of SLiM 2.1, this method changes the generation counter to the generation read from the file.  If you do not want the generation counter to be changed, you can change it back after reading, by setting

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Reschedule the target script block given by 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20  to execute in a specified set of generations.\
The first way to specify the generation set is with 
\f2\fs18 start
\f0\fs20  and 
\f2\fs18 end
\f0\fs20  parameter values; 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20  will then execute from 
\f2\fs18 start
\f0\fs20  to 
\f2\fs18 end
\f0\fs20 , inclusive.  In this case, 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20  is returned.\
The second way to specify the generation set is using the 
\f2\fs18 generations
\f0\fs20  parameter; this is more flexible but more complicated.  Since script blocks execute across a contiguous span of generations defined by their 
\f2\fs18 start
\f0\fs20  and 
\f2\fs18 end
\f0\fs20  properties, this may result in the duplication of 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20 ; one script block will be used for each contiguous span of generations in 
\f2\fs18 generations
\f3\fs20 .
\f0   The 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20  object itself will be rescheduled to cover the first such span, whereas duplicates of 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20  will be created to cover subsequent contiguous spans.  A vector containing all of the script blocks scheduled by this method, including 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20 , will be returned; this vector is guaranteed to be sorted by the (ascending) scheduled execution order of the blocks.  Any duplicates of 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20  created will be given values for the 
\f2\fs18 active
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 source
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20 , and 
\f2\fs18 type
\f0\fs20  properties equal to the current values for 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20 , but will be given an 
\f2\fs18 id
\f0\fs20  of 
\f2\fs18 -1
\f0\fs20  since script block identifiers must be unique; if it is necessary to find the duplicated blocks again later, their 
\f2\fs18 tag
\f0\fs20  property should be used.  The vector supplied for 
\f2\fs18 generations
\f0\fs20  does not need to be in sorted order, but it must not contain any duplicates.\
Because this method can create a large number of duplicate script blocks, it can sometimes be better to handle script block scheduling in other ways.  If an 
\f2\fs18 early()
\f0\fs20  event needs to execute every tenth generation over the whole duration of a long model run, for example, it would not be advisable to use a call like 
\f2\fs18 sim.rescheduleScriptBlock(s1, generations=seq(10, 100000, 10))
\f0\fs20  for that purpose, since that would result in thousands of duplicate script blocks.  Instead, it would be preferable to add a test such as 
\f2\fs18 if (sim.generation % 10 != 0) return;
\f0\fs20  at the beginning of the event.  It is legal to reschedule a script block while the block is executing; a call like 
\f2\fs18 sim.rescheduleScriptBlock(self, sim.generation + 10, sim.generation + 10);
\f0\fs20  made inside a given block would therefore also cause the block to execute every tenth generation, although this sort of self-rescheduling code is probably harder to read, maintain, and debug.\
Whichever way of specifying the generation set is used, the discussion in section 19.7 applies: 
\f2\fs18 block
\f0\fs20  may continue to be executed during the current life cycle stage even after it has been rescheduled, unless it is made inactive using its 
\f2\fs18 active
\f0\fs20  property, and similarly, the block may not execute during the current life cycle stage if it was not already scheduled to do so.  Rescheduling script blocks during the generation and life cycle stage in which they are executing, or in which they are intended to execute, should be avoided.\
Note that new script blocks can also be created and scheduled using the 
\f2\fs18 register...()
\f0\fs20  methods of 
\f2\fs18 SLiMSim
\f0\fs20 ; by using the same source as a template script block, the template can be duplicated and scheduled for different generations.  In fact, 
\f2\fs18 rescheduleScriptBlock()
\f0\fs20  does essentially that internally.

\f0\fs20  will cause the current simulation to end at the end of the current generation.  For example, a simulation might self-terminate if a test for a dynamic equilibrium condition is satisfied.  Note that the current generation will finish executing; if you want the simulation to stop immediately, you can use the Eidos method 
\f2\fs18 stop()
\f0\fs20 , which raises an error condition.

\f2\fs18 float
\f0\fs20  vector).  Otherwise, minimums are supplied for each coordinate used by the dimensionality of the simulation, followed by maximums for each.  In other words, if the declared dimensionality is

\f0\fs20 , the

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Defines a spatial map for the subpopulation.  The map will henceforth be identified by 
\f2\fs18 name
\f3\fs20 .
\f0   The map uses the spatial dimensions referenced by spatiality, which must be a subset of the dimensions defined for the simulation in 
\f2\fs18 initializeSLiMOptions()
\f3\fs20 .
\f0   Spatiality 
\f2\fs18 "x"
\f0\fs20  is permitted for dimensionality 
\f2\fs18 "x"
\f0\fs20 ; spatiality 
\f2\fs18 "x"
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 "y"
\f0\fs20 , or 
\f2\fs18 "xy"
\f0\fs20  for dimensionality 
\f2\fs18 "xy"
\f0\fs20 ; and spatiality 
\f2\fs18 "x"
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 "y"
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 "z"
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 "xy"
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 "yz"
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 "xz"
\f0\fs20 , or 
\f2\fs18 "xyz"
\f0\fs20  for dimensionality 
\f2\fs18 "xyz"
\f3\fs20 .
\f0   The spatial map is defined by a grid of values of a size specified by 
\f2\fs18 gridSize
\f0\fs20 , which must have one value per spatial dimension; for a spatiality of 
\f2\fs18 "xz"
\f0\fs20 , for example, 
\f2\fs18 gridSize
\f0\fs20  must be of length 
\f2\fs18 2
\f0\fs20 , specifying the size of the values grid in the 
\i x
\i0  and 
\i z
\i0  dimensions.  The parameter values then gives the values of the grid; it must be of length equal to the product of the 
\f2\fs18 gridSize
\f0\fs20  elements, and specifies values varying first in the 
\i x
\i0  dimension, then in 
\i y
\i0 , then in 
\i z
\f3\i0 .\

\f0 If 
\f2\fs18 interpolate
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 F
\f0\fs20 , values across the spatial map are not interpolated; the value at a given point is equal to the nearest value defined by the grid of values specified.  If 
\f2\fs18 interpolate
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20 , values across the spatial map will be interpolated (using linear, bilinear, or trilinear interpolation as appropriate) to produce spatially continuous variation in values.  In either case, the corners of the value grid are exactly aligned with the corners of the spatial boundaries of the subpopulation as specified by 
\f2\fs18 setSpatialBoundary()
\f0\fs20 , and the value grid is then stretched across the spatial extent of the subpopulation in such a manner as to produce equal spacing between the values along each dimension.  The setting of 
\f2\fs18 interpolation
\f0\fs20  only affects how values between these grid points are calculated: by nearest-neighbor, or by linear interpolation.\
The 
\f2\fs18 valueRange
\f0\fs20  and 
\f2\fs18 colors
\f0\fs20  parameters travel together; either both are unspecified, or both are specified.  They control how map values will be transformed into colors, by SLiMgui and by the 
\f2\fs18 spatialMapColor()
\f0\fs20  method.  The 
\f2\fs18 valueRange
\f0\fs20  parameter establishes the color-mapped range of spatial map values, as a vector of length two specifying a minimum and maximum; this does not need to match the actual range of values in the map.  The 
\f2\fs18 colors
\f0\fs20  parameter then establishes the corresponding colors for values within the interval defined by 
\f2\fs18 valueRange
\f0\fs20 : values less than or equal to 
\f2\fs18 valueRange[0]
\f0\fs20  will map to 
\f2\fs18 colors[0]
\f0\fs20 , values greater than or equal to 
\f2\fs18 valueRange[1]
\f0\fs20  will map to the last 
\f2\fs18 colors
\f0\fs20  value, and intermediate values will shade continuously through the specified vector of colors, with interpolation between adjacent colors to produce a continuous spectrum.  This is much simpler than it sounds in this description; see the recipes in chapter 14 for an illustration of its use.\
Note that at present, SLiMgui will only display spatial maps of spatiality 
\f2\fs18 "x"
\f0\fs20 , 
\f2\fs18 "y"
\f0\fs20 , or 
\f2\fs18 "xy"
\f0\fs20 ; the color-mapping parameters will simply be ignored by SLiMgui for other spatiality values (even if the spatiality is a superset of these values; SLiMgui will not attempt to display an 
\f2\fs18 "xyz"
\f0\fs20  spatial map, for example, since it has no way to choose which 2D slice through the 
\i xyz
\i0  space it ought to display).  The 
\f2\fs18 spatialMapColor()
\f0\fs20  method will return translated color strings for any spatial map, however, even if SLiMgui is unable to display the spatial map.  If there are multiple spatial maps with color-mapping parameters defined, SLiMgui will choose just one for display; it will prefer an 
\f2\fs18 "xy"
\f0\fs20  map if one is available, but beyond that heuristic its choice will be arbitrary.

In SLiM, it is often possible for a single individual to have multiple mutations at a given base position.  Because the VCF format is an explicit-nucleotide format, this property of SLiM does not fit well into VCF.  Since there are only four possible nucleotides at a given base position in VCF, at most one \'93reference\'94 state and three \'93alternate\'94 states could be represented at that base position.  SLiM, on the other hand, can represent any number of alternative possibilities at a given base; in general, if 
\i N
\i0  different mutations are segregating at a given position, there are 2
\i \super N
\i0 \nosupersub  different allelic states at that position in SLiM.  For this reason, SLiM does not attempt to represent multiple mutations at a single site as being alternative alleles in a single output line, as is typical in VCF format.  Instead, SLiM produces a separate line of VCF output for each segregating mutation at a given position.  SLiM always declares base positions as having a \'93reference base\'94 of 
\f2\fs18 A
\f0\fs20  (representing the state in individuals that do not carry a given mutation) and an \'93alternate base\'94 of 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  (representing the state in individuals that do carry the given mutation).  Multiallelic positions will thus produce VCF output showing multiple 
\f2\fs18 A
\f0\fs20 -to-
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  changes at the same position, possessed by different but possibly overlapping sets of individuals.  Many programs that process VCF output may not behave correctly with this style of output.  SLiM therefore provides a choice, using the 
\f2\fs18 outputMultiallelics
\f0\fs20  flag; if that flag is 
\f2\fs18 T
\f0\fs20  (the default), SLiM will produce multiple lines of output for multiallelic base positions, but will mark those lines with a 
\f2\fs18 MULTIALLELIC
\f0\fs20  flag in the 
\f2\fs18 INFO
\f0\fs20  field of the VCF output so that those lines can be filtered or processed in a special manner.  If 
\f2\fs18 outputMultiallelics
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 F
\f0\fs20 , on the other hand, SLiM will completely suppress output of all mutations at multiallelic sites \'96 often the simplest option, if doing so does not lead to bias in the subsequent analysis.  This flag has no effect upon the output of sites with only a single mutation present.  Assessment of whether a site is multiallelic is done only within the sample; segregating mutations that are not part of the sample are ignored.\

\f2\fs18 filePath
\f0\fs20  is 
\f2\fs18 NULL
\f0\fs20  (the default), output will be sent to Eidos\'92s output stream.  Otherwise, output will be sent to the filesystem path specified by

\pard\pardeftab720\li547\ri720\sb60\sa60\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs20 \cf0 The identifier of the subpopulation in which this mutation arose.  This value is carried over from the 
\f2\fs18 Mutation
\f0\fs20  object directly; if a \'93tag\'94 value was used in the 
\f2\fs18 Mutation
\f0\fs20  object, that value will carry over to the corresponding 
\f2\fs18 Substitution
\f0\fs20  object.  The 
\f2\fs18 subpopID
\f0\fs20  in 
\f2\fs18 Substitution
\f0\fs20  is a read-write property to allow it to be used as a \'93tag\'94 in the same way, if the origin subpopulation identifier is not needed.\
