set up testing code, check against old version of the code
add const keyword to references where appropriate, i.e. everywhere; pass by pointer when modification will occur
add private const copy constructors X(const X&) to all classes; nothing should be getting copied!
	private:

	Event(const Event&);						// disable copy constructor
	Event& operator = (const Event&);			// disable assignment operator

consider setting -ffast-math; see how much of a difference it makes, check with Philipp
consider switching to fast exponential code; do some profiling to see where hot spots are
consider checking the "unroll loops" pref; do timings
revisit float policy in light of Philipp's email, make sure it is optimal

changes to mention in docs:
	changed comment format from / to //
	revised example files to use new comment format
