To add a new test:

1. Put the recipe in the `testMutationRecipes/` or `testNoMutationRecipes/` directory, with a filename like `test_XXX.slim`.
2. Add the additional necessary stuff, like `source("testing_utils.slim");` : see examples.

To temporarily turn off a test, just add e.g. `dont_` to the start of its file name.
